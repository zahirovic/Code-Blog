# Code Blog

## Description

I created an application that functions as a tech blog.

#### The work done can be found on the GitHub repository [zahirovic/Code-Blog](https://github.com/zahirovic/Code-Blog). The live application can be found on [Heroku](https://code-blog-mz.herokuapp.com/) and should look along the lines of this:
